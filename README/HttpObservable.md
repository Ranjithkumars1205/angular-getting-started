Rxjs (Reactive Extensions):
A library for composing data using observable sequence.

and transforming that data using operators
  - similar to .NET LINQ operators

Angular uses Reactive Extensions for working with data
  - Especially asynchronous data

  Synchronous: real time -  phone call 

  Asynchronous: No immediate response - email - when i sent an email, i don't have to wait for a reply..


  What does an observable do?

  1. Nothing until we subscribe

  2. next: Next item is emitted

  3. error: An error occurred and no more items are emitted

  4. complete: No more items are emitted
